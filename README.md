RViz Cloud Annotation Tool
--------------------------

This is an annotation tool for 3D point clouds, based on the ROS (Robot Operating System) visualizer RViz.

The annotation tool lets the user partition a point cloud into parts. A text description may be assigned to each part.

In addition to rectangular and polyline selection, the tool provides assisted annotation based on Control Points. This requires normals and colors.

The standalone package `rviz_3d_view_controller` contains the Orbit3D View Controller plugin. The interface is similar to the default Orbit plugin, but it allows true 6DOF movement in 3D space.

**A new version upgraded to ROS 2 (Humble) has been published [here](https://github.com/RMonica/rviz2_cloud_annotation).**

### Installation

System requirements:

- ROS (Kinetic, Lunar, Melodic)
- Point Cloud Library (PCL) 1.7.2 or above
- GPU graphics acceleration is recommended

This repository contains ROS packages for the catkin build system. Place them into your workspace and recompile.

**Notice:**  
Catkin compiles the workspace in debug mode by default. Try enabling optimization. Example commands:

`catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`

`catkin build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`

**Note:**  
The use of `catkin_make` may interfere with other packages. Use `catkin build` (of the _catkin tools_ suite) whenever possible.

### Usage

A sample launch file is provided:

`roslaunch rviz_cloud_annotation example.launch`

The launch file starts RViz with the required plugin. A background node is also started. It uses the Interactive Marker interface to display the point cloud and intercept the click events.

By clicking on the point cloud, the user places control points on it.
A control point expands its label onto the neighboring points, until a maximum distance is reached or until another label stops it, coming from another control point.
The algorithm operates on a neighborhood graph.

The most effective way to use the tool is by adding control points on the background and on the objects. The control points compete for control of the nearby points. Add control points until the boundary between the labels is satisfying.

The weight system allows for the creation of "weaker" control points, which can control less points around them. A control point with weight 0 can control only the point where it's on.

#### Background node parameters

##### Save files  
- `cloud_filename` (string): the name of the point cloud to be annotated, in PCD format.
- `annotation_read_filename` (string): the annotation will be read from this file at startup, if existing.
- `annotation_write_filename` (string): the annotation will be saved to this file.
- `annotation_cloud` (string): an annotated cloud in PCD format, with `color` and `label` fields will also be saved into this file. Useful to be read by other software.
- `label_names_filename` (string): label names are saved into this file, in the format: `label_id: label_name`.
- `autosave_time` (double): auto-save period, 0 to disable.
- `autosave_append_timestamp` (bool): appends timestamp to autosave file name.

##### Control point algorithm configuration

**Warning**: When loading an annotation file, this configuration must match the original configuration.

- `neigh_search_type` (int): method to produce the neighborhood graph.
    - 0: radius search, `neigh_search_params` (string) is the distance
    - 1: max K nearest neighbors, `neigh_search_params` (string) is K
    - 2: min K nearest neighbors, `neigh_search_params` (string) is K
- `position_importance` (float): importance of euclidean distance in computations.
- `max_label_distance`: divided by `position_importance`, gives the maximum distance that may be affected by a single Control Point.
- `color_importance` (float): importance of color in computations, set to 0 if no color.
- `normal_importance` (float): importance of normals in computations.
- `weight_steps` (int): number of steps of the weight slider. **Warning:** increases memory usage!
